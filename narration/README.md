# narration folder
This folder is for narration recordings. Normally these could be checked in,
but *grumble grumble* limited space on github for lfs files prohibits it.
Files in this folder are IRREPLACABLE -- it would require another recording
session to reconstruct them, and even then the timing would likely be different.
