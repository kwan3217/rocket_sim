# Music of 3blue1brown

I'm trying to find my own style, and avoid being too similar to 
3blue1brown (within the context of using manim at all). Consequently,
I'm trying to avoid using the 3b1b soundtrack. Apparently it is
possible to get permission to use the songs in ones own videos, but
it's through a web form to ask permission. Having gotten the permission
for Zeta, here goes:

Hi [...]
