# Fonts
Fonts are from [GUST project](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor),
inherited from URW Gothic, which is a free replacement for Avant Garde developed
for the Ghostscript project

The fonts are distributed here in accordance to the GUST Font License,
which is an instance of the [LaTeX Project Public License](http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt).

To save space, the fonts are not going to be committed. They all are in
[qag2_501otf.zip](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor/qag2_501otf.zip)
and should be unpacked into this folder.
